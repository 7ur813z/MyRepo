Identification of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARG) from Protein Seqs

Description:
This project aims to create a model that's capable to identify Antibiotic Resistance Genes, only by analyzing its protein sequences.

The model was made from scratch containing 8 layers (2 Convolution layers, 1 MaxPooling layer, 1 Embedding layer, 2 Dropout layer, 1 bidirectional layer, 1 Dense layer)  

Training set accuracy : 95%
Test set accuracy : 95%
